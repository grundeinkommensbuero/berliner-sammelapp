The Berliner Sammelapp is an app for supporting citizens' signature campaigns. We are a continuation of the DWE Sammel-App. Currently, this app is maintained by various developers, partially on a volunteer basis and partially as part of the Expedition Grundeinkommen.

If you are interested in using the Sammelapp for your campaign, please get in touch at kontakt@expedition-grundeinkommen.de
