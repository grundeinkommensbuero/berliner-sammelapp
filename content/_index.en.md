Strengthen direct democracy in Berlin! The _Berliner Sammelapp_ supports citizens' signature campaigns for referendums!

With the app you can see upcoming events, register your participation, chat with other participants and report back afterwards. Whether it's a collection drive, a workshop, or an informational event â€“ the app lets you define, about what kind of actions in what area at what time you'd like to hear. Submit your own action, stay up to date with the campaign's developments or use the FAQ to brush up on common arguments and good answers to the most important questions about the current campaigns in Berlin.

The app code is [open source](https://gitlab.com/kybernetik/multi-sammel-app).
